This repository hosts my GitHub Pages site. The main page lives in `index.html` and is served directly from the main branch.

To preview the site locally, simply open `index.html` in a browser. Once pushed to GitHub with Pages enabled (under **Settings -> Pages**), it will be available at:

Feel free to check back for updates!
