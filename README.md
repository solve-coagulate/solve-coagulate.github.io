This repository hosts my GitHub Pages site. All of the HTML lives in the `docs/` folder so the main branch stays tidy.

The site is intentionally simple: a single HTML file with embedded CSS. It should serve as a good starting point for customizing your personal page.

To preview locally, open `docs/index.html` in a browser. Once pushed to GitHub with Pages enabled (under **Settings â†’ Pages** with `docs/` as the source), it will be available at:

```
https://solve-coagulate.github.io/
```

Feel free to edit the HTML or styles to make the site your own!
